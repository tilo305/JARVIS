# Iron Man Voice/Chatbot Website

This repository contains the necessary documentation and initial files for building an Iron Man-themed voice/chatbot website. The project aims to create an immersive and interactive experience, combining a visually engaging frontend with a powerful AI-driven backend.

## Project Overview

The website will feature a looping video of Iron Man as its background, providing a dynamic and thematic visual experience. A central chatbot interface, powered by ElevenLabs for voice functionalities and n8n for backend logic, will allow users to interact with an AI assistant in a conversational manner. The project leverages React/Next.js for the frontend, ensuring a modern, responsive, and scalable application.

## Features

*   **Immersive Visuals:** Looping Iron Man video background for an engaging user experience.
*   **Voice-Enabled Chatbot:** Seamless integration with ElevenLabs for natural speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS).
*   **AI-Powered Conversations:** Backend logic orchestrated by n8n workflows, including conversational memory and integration with OpenAI and Tavily for intelligent responses.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
*   **Thematic UI:** User interface designed to align with the Iron Man/JARVIS aesthetic.

## Documentation

This repository includes comprehensive documentation to guide the development and implementation process:

*   **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** `product_requirements_document.md`
    *   Outlines the high-level requirements, goals, target audience, and features of the website.
*   **Implementation Document:** `implementation_document.md`
    *   Provides a detailed technical plan, including frontend and backend implementation steps, architecture overview, and debugging/testing guidelines.
*   **Cursor Prompt:** `cursor_prompt.md`
    *   A full and complete prompt designed to be used with Cursor (or similar AI-assisted development environments) to facilitate the development process.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project, please refer to the `implementation_document.md` for detailed instructions on frontend setup (React/Next.js), video optimization, ElevenLabs widget integration, and n8n workflow configuration.

### Key Files

*   `Ironmanmoving.mp4`: The original Iron Man video file (requires conversion for web use).
*   `Memory_Automation.json`: The n8n workflow definition file.
*   `image.png`: A reference image depicting the desired website layout and aesthetic.

## Development

Follow the steps outlined in the `implementation_document.md` and leverage the `cursor_prompt.md` for AI-assisted development. Ensure all necessary API keys and credentials for ElevenLabs, n8n, OpenAI, and Airtable are properly configured.
