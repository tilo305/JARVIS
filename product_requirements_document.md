# Product Requirements Document: Iron Man Voice/Chatbot Website

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Iron Man-themed voice/chatbot website. The primary goal is to create an immersive and interactive experience for users, leveraging advanced AI capabilities for conversational interaction and a visually engaging interface. The website will feature a moving Iron Man MP4 as a central visual element, with a voice bot integrated seamlessly into the design. Backend operations, including conversational logic and data storage, will be managed by n8n workflows, while ElevenLabs will provide high-quality text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To deliver a highly engaging and functional Iron Man-themed voice/chatbot website that provides a seamless conversational experience.
*   **Objective 1: Immersive User Experience:** Create a visually appealing website with a prominent, moving Iron Man background that enhances user engagement.
*   **Objective 2: Natural Conversational Interface:** Implement a voice bot with ElevenLabs integration for natural-sounding speech and accurate speech recognition.
*   **Objective 3: Robust Backend Integration:** Utilize n8n for managing conversational flows, data persistence, and integration with external services.
*   **Objective 4: Scalability and Maintainability:** Develop the website using React/Next.js for a scalable and maintainable frontend architecture.

## 3. Target Audience

Fans of Iron Man, individuals interested in AI chatbots and voice assistants, and users seeking an interactive and unique digital experience.

## 4. Features

### 4.1. Visuals and User Interface

*   **Iron Man Moving Background:** The website will feature a looping MP4 video of Iron Man as the primary background. This video should be optimized for web playback and compatibility across various browsers and devices. The voice bot interface should not obscure the Iron Man visual significantly.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website must be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
*   **Thematic Design:** The overall design, including colors, fonts, and UI elements, will align with the Iron Man/JARVIS aesthetic, as depicted in the provided `image.png`.

### 4.2. Chatbot/Voice Bot Functionality

*   **Centralized Placement:** The chatbot interface will be positioned in the middle of the screen, ensuring visibility without dominating the Iron Man background.
*   **ElevenLabs Integration:**
    *   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** All text responses from the chatbot will be converted into natural-sounding speech using ElevenLabs voices.
    *   **Speech-to-Text (STT):** User voice input will be transcribed into text for processing by the chatbot.
    *   **Custom Microphone Button:** The microphone button within the chatbot interface will be the ElevenLabs widget URL (`<elevenlabs-convai agent-id="agent_7601k23b460aeejb2pvyfcvw6atk"></elevenlabs-convai><script src="https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed" async type="text/javascript"></script>`), replacing the default ElevenLabs widget image.
*   **Conversational Memory:** The chatbot will maintain conversational context and memory, leveraging the n8n workflow's database integration (Airtable, as indicated in `Memory_Automation.json`).
*   **Text Input:** Users will also have the option to interact with the chatbot via text input.

### 4.3. Backend and Integrations

*   **n8n Workflow Management:** All backend logic, including processing user input, generating responses, and managing conversational memory, will be handled by n8n workflows. The provided `Memory_Automation.json` serves as the foundation for this.
*   **Webhook Integration:** The n8n workflow will be triggered via a webhook (`https://n8n.hempstarai.com/webhook/061f91ff-420a-4040-bff7-5f81fb9fb9cd`) for communication with the frontend.
*   **Database Integration:** The n8n workflow will connect to a database (Airtable, based on the provided JSON) for storing chat messages and voice data, enabling persistent memory for the chatbot.
*   **OpenAI Integration:** The `Memory_Automation.json` indicates the use of OpenAI for the AI Agent, suggesting that the conversational intelligence will be powered by OpenAI's language models.
*   **Tavily Integration:** The `Memory_Automation.json` also includes Tavily for internet search, allowing the AI agent to gather current information.

## 5. Technical Requirements

*   **Frontend Framework:** React/Next.js.
*   **Video Optimization:** The Iron Man MP4 will need to be converted to a web-friendly format (e.g., WebM, MP4 with H.264 codec) and optimized for efficient streaming and minimal load times.
*   **API Communication:** Secure and efficient communication between the frontend (React/Next.js), n8n webhooks, and ElevenLabs API.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms for all integrations (ElevenLabs, n8n, database) to ensure a smooth user experience even during unexpected issues.
*   **Security:** Implementation of security best practices for webhook endpoints and API keys.

## 6. Future Considerations

*   **Customizable Voices:** Option for users to select different ElevenLabs voices.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Extend chatbot capabilities to support multiple languages.
*   **Advanced AI Features:** Integration of more sophisticated AI features, such as sentiment analysis or personalized recommendations.

## 7. Mockups/References

*   `image.png`: Provides a visual reference for the desired website layout and aesthetic.

## 8. Open Questions

*   Specific font families and color palette to be used for the UI elements.
*   Detailed interaction design for the chatbot (e.g., typing indicators, message animations).
*   Error message display strategy for users.
